# audible2020project
This is all of the code for the GoodReads API summer project for my internship at Audible, during August of 2020. The other interns andI settled on the name 
"Project Appa" on the second to last day of the program.
I'm not going to write about what the code does at length because there are comments in the individual files. This project is not really for public use, I'll
probably set it to private if I can, so for anyone other than me reading this, this repo is mainly just for me to save my code after offboarding.
